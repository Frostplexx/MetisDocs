# Deployment

## Installation

To setup pm2 please follow the guide on the [DiscordJS Docs](https://discordjs.guide/improving-dev-environment/pm2.html#installation).

## Running the process

For deployment we use pm2. Install it on your server and optionally configure the web dashboard. With `npm run prod` you can start Metis with pm2. Now you can open [pm2.io](https://pm2.io) in a browser and monitor the bot! It even has custom metrics.
