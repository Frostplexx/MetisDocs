# Setup

## Prerequisits
* Nodejs
* npm
* A server or something where you can run the bot on.
* Python
* patience

## Initial Setup
1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Frostplexx/DnD_Helper.git`.
2. run `npm i` to install the required packages. If you don't have python 2 install (which you should't) run `npm config set python /path/to/python3` otherwise sqlite 3 wont install.
3. go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new Application.
4. Go to the bot tab and create a new bot.
5. Run the bot with `npm run start`. The bot will generate some files and ask you for some IDs like your bot token or the application id.
most of these IDs can be gathered at the discord developer portal.
4. The bot should run now.
